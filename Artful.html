                    <p>
                        I completed the landing page for a group project of a
                        few people. Our project was to make an app where artists
                        could upload and display their various works of art.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was not in charge of any functionality of the app. I
                        was in charge of the over all look. The design of these
                        marketing pages and their layout, were made by me. You
                        can click the link to "Sign Up!", but you will be
                        directed away from my work.
